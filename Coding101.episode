    If you're new to Episode's writer portal and want to learn things such as where to upload backgrounds and how to create outfits- this introduction is for you!
    The introduction lessons are a bit long, but that's because I wanted to cover the important points in the portal itself before we start to direct.
    If you already know how to do those things, feel free to start watching |color:blue| Lesson #1|reset , no-space|.
    If you're new to the portal, I highly recommend that you watch the introduction lessons.

    I used it a lot when I started, and if you feel like checking it out, feel free to do so!
    Just for disclaimer purposes, most of the things I learned to code I learned from there, so this course and the guides are gonna teach you very similar things.
    Many people find reading the guides tiring and they lose concentration. That's the main reason I created this course!
    The purpose of this course is to teach you how to code in a more "modern" approach, rather by reading pages and pages, like a textbook.

    This is the art catalog! The place where all your backgrounds and overlays come from!
    The page will automatically open on the background option. If you want to go to the overlay section, tap the "Overlays" button that's located right next to the "Backgrounds" button!
    The backgrounds and overlays sections look pretty much the same, so I will only explain the following on the backgrounds- but it works in the overlays tab too!
    Underneath the "Backgrounds" button, you can see there's a button called "Backgrounds: Available for ALL Stories".
    If you click it, you'll have the choice to look at the backgrounds you uploaded.
    Before you upload any art to the portal, |bold| what is allowed or not allowed to be uploaded?
    The images you upload must be either created by you or you have permission to use them from the creator.
    It should also be appropriate for readers ages 13 and up.
    |bold| things that could make Episode reject your backgrounds or overlays:|reset| Brand names or logos, pictures of celebrities, pornographic images, text that contains uncensored swear words and more.
    When Episode reject an image, they always tell you why it was rejected.
    I highly recommend reading Episode's |bold| guidelines |reset| for the exact rules on just about anything before you publish your story or send an image for review.
    The time it takes the Episode team to approve images varies- sometimes it's only a few hours, sometimes it can even take a week.
    Usually it takes them 2-4 days.

    This is where you'll be working on your stories - the "My Stories" tab!
    Let me show you the important steps of starting a new story!
    The first thing you'll want to do is... well, create your story!
    Tap the "Start New Story" button in the top left corner of the screen and write the name you wish to have for your story.
    |bold| Notice! |reset| While you can always change the name of your story as you wish, the first name you'll type will become a part of the web address for the story.
    Does it matter? Not really. But you're gonna see this name in your URL all the time.
    So if you don't want to stare at an old name all the time, you should definitely decide on a name before starting out.

        NARRATOR
    What you'll probably want to do now is create your characters. It can be done in the "Characters" button.
    Assuming that you're only now creating your first character, the portal will ask you a few questions about how you want the story to work.

    The first question will be which art style you want to use.
    Episode currently has 3 art styles: |bold| Classic |reset , no-space|, |bold| Ink |reset , no-space|, and |bold| Limelight |reset , no-space|.
    |bold| Classic |reset| is the oldest style and you can find it in stories such as The Ember Effect by Joseph Evans and Dripping Mascara by Genevieve Marshall (both are amazing stories, by the way!)
    To be completely honest with you, I cannot recommend choosing Classic as the art style for your story.
    As it's the oldest style on Episode, it's also considered the least visually pleasant to look at.
    Many readers refuse to read stories in Classic. Most of them do, actually.
    The Classic style also has quite a lot of bugs in it that Episode won't fix because they announced that they don't work on the style anymore.
    If you do want to write in Classic, I highly recommend that you head over to YouTube and check Joseph Evans' tutorial! He has an old Classic tutorial there that could really help you out!
@pause for .5
        NARRATOR
    |bold| Ink |reset| is the second Episode art style and you can find it in stories such as Mean Girls and Demi Lovato by Episode.
    Ink is an older and simpler style than the newest one Episode has, meaning that it is less diverse and has less variety in terms of what your characters look like.
    In my opinion, Ink has the best animations on Episode. They're the most realistic, natural looking and they convey emotions really well.
    However, as it's an older style, Episode do not release any new assets to it and it gets no updates. What you have is what you got.
    In addition, many Episode readers won't read stories in Ink, and only want to read in the newest style.
    Some loyal Ink readers and writers only read and write in Ink, but the majority of the community doesn't do that.
    If you like Ink, that's great! It's a great art style! Just note that this coding course uses the newest art style.
    What does that mean to you? Not much. Just that what you'll see in the course itself won't be in Ink and that the animations will have a different name.
    You can definitely use this course to learn how to code in Ink.
@pause for .5
        NARRATOR
    |bold| Limelight (or in short, LL) |reset| is the newest Episode style and you can find it in stories such as College-ish and Love Life by Episode.
    It is also the art style this coding course uses. If you're just starting out, most chances that you'll want to choose Limelight as the art style for your story!
    This art style is known for having many assets that will make your characters very diverse.
    The art style is also considered "semi-realistic" and looks less cartoonish than Ink does.
    This art style gets updates almost every Thursday, with new clothes and assets released for us to use.

    The next thing the portal will ask you is which format you'd like to direct in.
    |bold| Important! Choose the Cinematic (full body) format! NOT The Spotlight one!
    Okay, okay, you're probably confused as to why I'm not telling you to choose yourselves like I did with the art styles.
    The reason is that if you choose Cinematic, you can always switch from Cinematic to Spotlight and back as much as you want.
    If you choose Spotlight now, there's no regretting it! You'll have to write in Spotlight the entire story.
    Why is it like that? Wish I knew. But it is what it is, right? So choose Cinematic.
    And now that you did, let me tell you what's the difference between the two modes.
    |bold| Cinematic |reset| mode is the one where characters move around and do things.
    The characters are seen from their head to their toes and they can move like they're in the scene.
    |bold| Spotlight |reset| is considered easier, because all you need to do is animate your characters talking.
    The characters are shown from the waist up in a window while they're talking, similar to a lot of other interactive apps.

    Also, if anyone cares, that's the first time ever that I coded something in Spotlight mode. I have no idea what I'm doing.
        TAL (talk_explain_neutral)
    Most readers don't like it, and I prefer the Cinematic mode too, because there's so much more you can do with it.

    Of course you can use Spotlight if you want, but just know that this course is here to teach you how to code in Cinematic format.

    The starting actor you choose really doesn't matter, all that matters is their body type.
    Episode currently has 3 body types- Generic Female, Plus-Sized Female and Male.
    Choose an actor/actress that uses the body type you want to give your character!
    As for naming your character, you should know that every character you make has 2 names - The |color:red|Script name|reset| and the |color:green| Display name|reset , no-space|.
    The |color:red|Script name|reset| is the name you choose right now, and you can't change it after you hit save.
    This is what the portal will recognize your character as.
    You're gonna have to type this name a lot, so if the character name is long, I recommend writing a shortened name here (like a nickname) to save time.
    I don't recommend giving a character a |color:red|Script name|reset| with over 5 letters. I usually give them 2-4 letters.
    The |color:green| Display name|reset| is the name your readers will see on screen. You can make it longer, if you want, like I did with the "posh accent" joke in the beginning of this course.
    You can also delete it to create a character with no name at all.

    When you first opened your new chapter, this is what was written in the script.
    See what's written in line 1? |bold| This is a background setting.
    |bold| Here's how you'll place your own background into the portal:
    Episode backgrounds' names are always written in all caps. This is extremely important- if you don't capitalize the name of the background, you will get an error in your script.
    Episode backgrounds also have to start with |bold| INT. |reset| or |bold| EXT. |reset| in order to help the script understand this is a background.
    |reset|INT. or EXT. will always be the beginning of the background name.
    Enough talking, you probably want to put a background that isn't just this black screen, right?
@pause for .3
        NARRATOR
    Want to code along with me? That's honestly the best way to study!
    Open the first chapter of your story and delete the first 3 lines that you can see here on the screen.
    Now, where do we take the backgrounds from?
    We're gonna need to open a new tab along with our script and open the Art Catalog.
    You can easily do this by right-clicking the Art Catalog button at the top of your screen and select "Open link in new tab".
    In the art catalog, you can find lots of backgrounds! All you have to do is |bold| copy the name |reset| of the one you chose and paste it into an empty line in your script!
    That's it, you're done. Easy, right?
    Later in the course we will also get to overlays, and I'll show you how to add them to this line. For now, this is all you need to know.
    Notice that if you save your script now it will give you an error, just because the script wants you to write something after the scene begins.
    It doesn't allow you to end an episode with a scene change. Just ignore the error for now. We're about to change that in the next lesson!
    One last thing I want to tell you is: If you uploaded your own background and the Episode team hasn't approved it yet, you'll get an error.
    Just ignore it and wait for the team to approve it. Then, just save your script and the error will be gone!

        TAL (talk_shrug_neutral)
    You have to write the name of the speaker or the word narrator in all caps! If you don't, you'll get an error.
        TAL (talk_gossip)
    Each sentence of your text has to start with a capital letter! If you don't... you guessed it! You'll get an error!
        TAL (talk_pointup_happy)
    This is more of a tip- you can write "NARR" instead of "NARRATOR" if you want. It's the same thing!
        TAL (talk_deny_neutral)
    Sometimes, the character name will appear in |color:red| red |reset| instead of |color:blue|blue|reset , no-space|. Don't panic!
        TAL (talk_shrug_neutral)
    It could happen for 3 reasons I know of. The first one is just a script slip-up.
        TAL (talk_neutral)
    Sometimes, even computers make mistakes. It won't give you an error, and if you reload the script, it will fix itself.
        TAL (talk_pointup_pretentious)
    The second option is that you didn't put the right amount of spaces before the speaker name. Maybe you're missing a space, or maybe you put an extra space somewhere.
        TAL (talk_agree_happy)
    Do not fear! It won't give you an error and if you reload the page, it should fix the problem for you.
        TAL (talk_reassure_neutral)
    In general, remember to not fear the script, even if you get an error. Everything is fixable!
        TAL (talk_shrug_concerned)
    The last option is that you put the name of the character incorrectly. Just fix it, and it's all gonna be fine.
        TAL (talk_pointup_pretentious)
    If you don't, though, you will get an error. But again, fix the name, save the script and you're good to go!

    And if you want to skip to a new line but in the same speechbubble, [nl] like this,

    Write the letters "nl" in square brackets whenever you want to create a new line! The "nl" will be invisible but will create a new line for you!

    Here's the last question for this quiz, and it's a bit tricky, so pay attention!
    This text will give you an error. Why?
choice
"There are two sentences in one line" {
        NARRATOR
    Sorry, but that's incorrect. There really are two sentences in the same line, but that's not forbidden.
    The problem is that the sentence doesn't start with a capital letter, so the script doesn't understand it's supposed to be a sentence and not a command!
    Don't worry about it though, the more you code and the more errors you make, the faster you'll learn to avoid making mistakes and spotting them!
} "The name TAL is red instead of blue" {
        NARRATOR
    Sorry, but that's incorrect. The name is red, but it's only gonna be an error if you misspelled the name of your character. Most of the time, it's not an error and it's gonna fix itself!
    In this case, if you look closely, I put an extra space before the name. It's not gonna be an error and will get fixed after you reload the page.
    The problem is that the sentence doesn't start with a capital letter, so the script doesn't understand it's supposed to be a sentence and not a command!
    Don't worry about it though, the more you code and the more errors you make, the faster you'll learn to avoid making mistakes and spotting them!
} "The line doesn't start with a capital letter" {
        NARRATOR
    Correct! Well done, this was a tough one!
    The lack of a capital letter at the beginning of your text will confuse the portal and make it think that this is a command it needs to perform, so you'll get an error!
} "Trick question- this code is perfectly fine." {

    |bold| Welcome to Lesson #3: "Know Your Symbols (@,&,#)"
        NARRATOR
    This lesson's topic usually comes up much later in other guides and directing tutorials I've seen.
    But honestly, I think it's a simple and important thing to know, so I chose to teach it right as we start.
    A lot of guides skip on explaining very basic things, and just show you what you need to write to do certain things.
    You end up copy and pasting from the guides cluelessly, which is okay. But I believe that understanding what you're doing is a key part in learning things fast and effectively.
    And while you can always replay this lesson and remember how to do things, my goal is to help you understand why things happen, so you can remember them much faster and everything makes more sense.
    So, let's begin.
label lesson3part1
@pause for .5
        NARRATOR
    Episode is an app that follows a list of commands, which is actually what your script is.
    In order for the app to understand what you're asking it to do, the commands you write have to start with certain symbols.
    When writing those symbols, you're explaining the app what you want it to do with your command.
    Basically, the command you write is |bold| the information you give the app|reset,no-space|, and the symbol you use at the beginning of the command is |bold| what you want the app to do with this info.
    Let me give you a quick example, since I know this can be a little confusing.

    The first one is the @ symbol. This is considered the "standard" symbol and you will probably use it the most.
    This symbol tells the script that it needs to do one thing at a time, like a chores list.
    First do this, and when you finish, do something else.
    If I use this symbol to make the two Tals dance, It'll seem like this:
@TAL is dance_drop_it
@TAL2 is dance_drop_it
        NARRATOR
    I said to the portal "Make Tal 1 dance, then when she's done, make Tal 2 dance".
&TAL is idle AND TAL2 is idle
        NARRATOR
    This is how your script will usually behave. It will start with a line and will only go to the next line when it's done with the current line.
    But what if I want both Tals to dance at the same time?

        NARRATOR
    The second symbol is here to help us just with that!
    Let's say that you want several things to happen at the same time.
    The & symbol will tell the app "start doing this, and don't wait for it to end. Immediately move on to the next line."
    So if I tell Tal 1 to start dancing using the & symbol, and then tell Tal 2 to dance using @, they will do it together, at the same time.
    Why? Because as soon as Tal 1 will start to dance, the app will tell Tal 2 to dance too, and will wait for Tal 2 to stop before reading what's written next.
    By giving Tal 1's command the & symbol and Tal 2's command the @ symbol, it will look like this:
&TAL is dance_drop_it
@TAL2 is dance_drop_it

        NARRATOR
    This is the last symbol, and actually, not everyone uses it.
    Why? Because this symbol tells the script "Hey, what I wrote here? Ignore this, please".
    Whatever you write on this line, even if it's not a code, it won't give you an error. The script ignores this line as if it doesn't exist.
    What is it good for, then? I use it when I write to leave myself notes.
    I usually write the dialogue before I direct my chapters, so I leave myself notes of what should be happening on the screen for when I start directing.
    Some template users leave notes to the people who use their templates this way. Things like "don't forget to credit me" or "you need to write the name of your character here".
    Like I said, not everyone uses that. But I told you it exists so that you can decide for yourself if you're gonna use it or not.
    That's it, those are the symbols you need to know. I recommend that you practice using them as soon as you learn more commands in the next lessons of this course.
    I hope this was all clear and helpful to you guys!

    |bold| Welcome to Lesson #4: "Basic Directing - Part 1/2"
label basicspot
        NARR
    In this lesson, and in lessons 5-7, you will learn how to put your characters on the screen and make them walk, enter & exit the scene.
    |bold| Notice! |reset| There are 2 ways to place your characters and move them.
    The easiest way is called |color:magenta| "basic directing"|reset , no-space|, and the more complex one is called |color:royalblue| "advanced directing" |reset| or |color:royalblue| "spot directing".
    Most guides teach you |color:magenta| basic directing |reset| first, and after you know how to use it, they teach you |color:royalblue| advanced directing.
    I will be teaching them both simultaneously.
    |bold| What you need to know: |reset| Basic directing is simpler and you will most likely start coding faster.
    |bold| However |reset , no-space|, the options in basic directing are very limited and many readers will tell you're using this technique right away.
    |color:magenta| Basic directing |reset| is considered to be used only by novice authors and is looked down upon. Stories with |color:royalblue| advanced directing |reset| look better because the characters can be resized and placed wherever you want.
    I'm leaving the choice to you. You can choose to learn only |color:magenta| basic directing |reset , no-space|, only |color:royalblue|advanced directing |reset, no-space|, or you can start with |color:magenta| basic |reset| and move on to |color:royalblue| advanced |reset| later on.
    You |bold| do not |reset| need to know |color:magenta| basic directing |reset| in order to learn |color:royalblue| advanced directing|reset , no-space|. These are two different techniques and they do not depend on each other.
    This lesson and lesson #5 teach |color:magenta| basic directing |reset , no-space|. Lessons 6&7 teach |color:royalblue| advanced directing |reset , no-space|. Do you want to continue with this lesson or go back to the main menu and go learn |color:royalblue|advanced directing |reset , no-space|?

    Let's start with placing your character on screen.
    In basic directing, there are 5 locations where your character can stand + 4 others that are less used.
@TAL stands screen center
        TAL (talk_neutral_atcamera_loop)
    This spot is called |bold| screen center.
@TAL stands screen left AND TAL faces right
        TAL
    This spot is called |bold| screen left.
@TAL stands screen right AND TAL faces left
        TAL
    This spot is called |bold| screen right.
@TAL stands upscreen left AND TAL faces right
        TAL (talk_think_neutral)
    This spot is called |bold| upscreen left. |reset| It's located between screen left and screen center.
@TAL stands upscreen right AND TAL faces left
        TAL (talk_think_neutral)
    This spot is called |bold| upscreen right. |reset| It's located between screen right and screen center.
        TAL (talk_neutral_atcamera_loop)
    These are the basic five locations your characters can stand at. The other four are:
@TAL stands back far left AND TAL faces right
        TAL
    Back far left,
@TAL stands back left AND TAL faces right

    After you've learned how to place, remove, and move characters in your story, it's time to learn how to make them enter and exit the screen.

        NARR
    Advanced directing is the method most successful Episode authors use when directing their story.
    It gives you much more freedom to place your characters wherever you want. Because of that, it's a bit harder to learn.
    But as soon as you'll learn how to use it and practice, it will come naturally to you.
    Let's begin!

    So before I start showing you all of these confusing numbers, let's explain what they mean!

@overlay ZZZ101_32 opacity 1 in .5
@pause for .5

        NARR
    In order to spot direct, you need to know the dimensions of a zone.
    A zone is the part of the background you're able to see when you don't zoom in or out of the screen. We'll learn more about zones and zooms later in the course.
    |bold| Each zone is 320 units wide and 568 units tall.
    And now that we understand that, we can start explaining how spot directing works.
    When spot directing, you have the ability to control 3 factors: how |bold , color:magenta| big |reset| your character is, what's the |bold , color:blue| horizontal unit |reset| they're standing on, and what's the |bold , color:orange| vertical unit |reset| they're standing on.

&overlay ZZZ101_33 opacity 1 in .5
@pause for .5
        NARR
    This is what a typical spotting code looks like.
    The first number in the code, in our case - 1.050, is the |bold , color:magenta| size |reset| number. It indicates how big the character is.
    If you set the character size to 0, the character will be invisible. If you put a minus sign before it, the character will be upside-down.
    The second number in the code is the |bold , color:blue| horizontal unit |reset| of your character. I set mine to 160, which is half of the total 320 units a zoom has. This is why she's standing in the middle of the screen.
    The smaller the number I choose, the more to the left my character will stand. The larger, the more to the right she will stand.
    And the last number is the |bold , color:orange| vertical unit |reset , no-space| , Which determines how high or low the character is standing.

label lesson7part1
        NARR

    You don't want them to pop in and out of a scene all the time, right?

&overlay 5451627470782464_ZZZ101_39 moves to layer -11
        NARR
    Unfortunately, there isn't an entering or exiting command for Advanced directing.
    Spot directing has one, but if you use it, your characters will change size when entering or exiting the scene and it will look really bad.
    Instead, here's the way you can make your characters enter or exit the scene and make it look good. It's actually not that hard!
    Remember how in |color:royalblue| Lesson #6 |reset| I taught you how each zone is located in the horizontal units 0-320?
    It means that if your character is standing in this range, it will be visible onscreen.
    If you want to make your character enter a scene, you need to place it in a unit that won't be visible and then make it walk to a visible unit.
    Here's an example:
&overlay ZZZ101_39 opacity 1 in 1
@TAL spot 1.050 -100 100
@TAL walks to spot 1.050 160 100 in 2
@TAL moves to layer -13
        NARR
    Did you see my character walk into the screen?
    I made her appear someplace where you can't see her, and then used the walking command we learned in the previous lesson to make it seem like she entered the scene.
    Clever, right?
    Notice that I only changed my character's |bold| horizontal unit |reset| (middle number), I didn't touch her size or vertical unit.
    That's why she walked into the screen in a straight line from left to right!
&overlay ZZZ101_39 opacity 0 in .7 THEN overlay ZZZ101_39 clear
        NARR
    |bold| One last important thing to know- |reset| When your character is standing outside of the horizontal unit range of a zone, but very close to it, it will still be partially seen.

@TAL spot 1.050 -10 100

        NARR
    My character's horizontal unit is now -10. It's out of the range, but you can still see her a little bit, because she's wider than one unit.
    It's bad, because now your readers will see her suddenly appearing.
    So a good rule of thumb to remember when you want to put characters offscreen is:
    If they're on the left side, make them stand in unit -100 or lower. If on the right, make them stand in unit 400 or higher.
&TAL walks to spot 1.050 160 100
        NARR
    This way, your characters will definitely be offscreen and your readers won't be able to see them before they enter.

        NARR
    Animations that contain the word "loop" are animations that repeat themselves.
    Funny enough, all of my previous animation examples were also looping.
    To stop a command from looping, you have to replace it with a different one. An "idle" command will usually be the best choice.

    Animations with the word "rear" in it will make your characters face away from the camera and show you their back.

    This enormous number of animations can be quite overwhelming, I know.
    What's important to know is that you're not expected to remember them all immediately.
    And while at first you'll have to look every single animation up, eventually you will remember the ones which are most useful to you.
    So don't pressure yourself into memorizing them all. I know it's not easy. It takes time and lots and lots of practice.
    The more you write, the more you will have to use these animations. And eventually, you'll remember them.

    Before we end this lesson, I'd like to teach you one last trick that can really help you start.
    I personally never use it, because after writing four stories, I remember all of the animations I need and what they look like.
    But it could really help you start using and remembering animation names.
        NARR
    Episode has certain "animation categories" that divide talking animations into groups based on their emotions.
    The groups are: |color:plum| happy, sad, angry, neutral & surprised.
    Instead of writing the animation name next to each line of dialogue, you can write the name of one of these five groups, in brackets, like you do with animations.
    As soon as you save your script, it will automatically replace the group name with a random animation that belongs to this group.
    If you want, you can replace an animation that you don't like manually later. But it's a good, fast way to insert animations into your script and start remembering their names.
    Notice that it will only work with animations that come with dialogue. But nevertheless, I think it can really help you get started.

        NARRATOR
    |bold| Welcome to Lesson #9: "Animations & How They Work - Part 2/2"
label lesson9part1
        NARR
    In the previous lesson we started learning how to put animations in our stories.
    We learned how to put animations with our dialogue, and we learned how to use them separately.
    However, there are 3 commands that are used to insert animations without the text, and each of them has slightly different results.
    It's important to know the differences between them, because sometimes using the wrong command can cause glitches in the animation.
    Let's refresh for a second what's our first command, the one we learned in |color:royalblue| Lesson #8|reset , no-space|.
    The "is" command is the standard command everyone uses. The format is very simple: [nl] |color:royalblue| CHARACTER |reset| is |color:green| animation |reset , no-space|.
    But "is" has two brother-commands that work a little different. Let's start with "starts".
    The starts command has a very similar format to the "is" command: [nl] |color:royalblue| CHARACTER |reset| starts |color:green| animation |reset , no-space|.
    |bold| What is the difference between the two commands?
    Remember how in |color:royalblue| Lesson #3 |reset| we learned the difference between the @ and & commands?
    This is basically the difference between the commands. The "is" command will tell the script to wait until the animation is done playing out, and then will continue the script.
    The "starts" command won't wait and the next line in your code will immediately activate.
    Then why is it needed? If we use the & symbol with the "is" command, the result will be the same, right?
    Well yes, but actually no.
    The result will be the same, but as you'll learn in future lessons, there is a way to put several commands in a single line of code.
    The entire line will depend on the symbol you put at the beginning. So if you want an animation to start in the middle of a @ sequence, you're gonna have to use starts.
    This command is the least useful one because you can use the & symbol with an "is" command and get the same result.
    But if you're willing to create a sequence of codes, you'll have to know it exists. Many advanced directors use it in their stories, and I'm one of them.

        NARR
    Now that we know what the "is" and "starts" commands are, let's meet the last command. "does it while".
    This command is used for animating while your characters are moving. I see so many beginner authors use the "is" command, run into glitches and struggle to solve them.
    Lots of authors tell me they don't understand what it's needed for and that they're too lazy to use it because of its long name.
    But while it doesn't always happen, if you use the "is" command on characters that walk, your readers might see a split second of your character idling.
readerMessage Thank you @j.miley.stories for letting me know why and when this happens!
        NARR
    This usually happens because the duration of the animation is longer than the time you've given your characters to walk.

        NARR
    Let me show you what will happen if you don't use the "does it while" command and try to use the "is" command instead.
    My character is about to enter the scene while she'll be dancing, and then she'll continue dancing in her place.
    Watch what happens if I use the "is" command while she's walking:
@TAL walks to spot 1.279 160 -32 in 1 AND TAL is dance_wavehands_happy_loop
@TAL is dance_wavehands_happy_loop
        NARR
    Did you notice that she stopped dancing for a split second and just stood there?
    This is the glitch effect I was talking about earlier. It looks like a weird glitch the character is having and it looks bad.
&TAL walks to spot 1.279 380 -32 in 2 AND TAL does it while dance_wavehands_happy_loop THEN remove TAL
        NARR
    This is why I recommend always using "does it while" when a character is walking, and either "is" or "starts" when characters don't walk.
@TAL spot 1.279 -45 -32 AND TAL moves to layer -25
        NARR
    Let me show you how this will look if I use the "does it while" command instead.

    Uh--
    Oh, no... This... This is a problem...
    The red Tal needs to stand behind the blue Tal, but for some reason we see red Tal in front of blue Tal.
    So whenever you have more than one character onscreen, it's important to tell the script which character should be closer to the camera.
    This is what we have |color:teal| layers |reset| for.
    Layers are a number you assign for each character in your scene, and the bigger the number, the closer your character is to the camera.
    So if I tell red Tal to be in layer 1 and blue Tal to be in layer 2...

    Notice that when you tell your character to walk somewhere, it will automatically face the direction it needs to face.
    And if you don't tell them where to face, and don't tell them where to go, they will face a random direction. So my advice is to always specify where your characters should be facing!
    Sometimes you check your script and the character faces the right direction for you, but as soon as someone else tries to read it, the character might be facing the other way.
    So don't forget to tell your characters where to look at the beginning of each scene if they don't walk into the screen!

    Now that we covered left and right, there are two more directions your characters can look at.
    Remember when we talked in |color:royalblue| Lesson #8 |reset| about types of animations?
    If so, you probably remember that we said that animations with the word |color:green| rear |reset| will make your characters stand with their backs to the camera.
    This is what I consider the other two directions your character can face.

    |bold| Well, not really.
    Rear animations have one little catch that usually makes new writers incredibly frustrated.
    As long as you remember that this catch exists, you can easily overcome it. And the catch is...
    For an unknown reason, when using rear animations, |bold| the directions for your characters to look at get flipped.
    What does it mean? That as long as you use rear animations, if you tell your character to face |color:blue| left |reset , no-space|, it will face |color:red| right |reset , no-space|.
    And if you tell your character to face |color:red| right |reset , no-space|... it will face |color:blue| left |reset , no-space|.
    Let me demonstrate. My character is currently facing right.
    I am going to tell it to use a rear animation, and I |bold| will not |reset| tell it to face a new direction.

    One of the most useful things you will do with rear commands is making characters kiss and hug.
    When kissing or hugging, one of your characters will perform a regular animation while the other one performs a rear animation.
    If you want your characters to kiss or hug onscreen, you're gonna have to make sure a few things:
    1) The |bold| rear |reset| character is on a higher layer than the other character.
    If you need a reminder about layers, go back to |color:royalblue| Lesson #10 |reset , no-space|.
    And 2) Your characters must be facing |bold| the same direction.
    Why? Because your rear character will actually be facing the opposite direction, remember?

        NARR
    For my example, I've decided that I want the red-wearing Tal to be the one who hugs from rear, while the blue Tal will hug from front.
    Now, both Tals need to be facing the same directing, but they're currently facing each other.
    So as soon as they start hugging, I'll ask one of them to face a different direction.
    How do I decide which one to ask? |bold| I always change the rear character |reset , no-space|.
    Because the front character is facing the right way, remember? Red Tal stands to the right, so Blue Tal needs to face right in order to look at her.
    But rear animations are the ones flipping things. Therefore, I will tell my rear character to face right as well.
    In the script it will be written that they both face right, but onscreen, Red Tal will face rear-left.
    Look at what happens if I |bold| don't |reset| change anyone's direction.

        NARR
    Alright, let's get started!
    Just like with entering and exiting, advanced directing doesn't have a command for that like basic directing does.
    But we can use the tools we already know in order to make the camera follow a character to a different zone!
    Remember how in |color:royalblue| lesson #3 |reset| we learned about @ and & commands?
    This information is going to be very useful to us now.
    If we want several commands to happen at the same time, we write all commands with a & symbol aside from the last one, which will be a @ command.
    If you don't remember or you're unsure what I'm talking about, make sure to go watch |color:royalblue| lesson #3 |reset| again!
    To create a "follow" effect, we need to make our characters walk somewhere and at the same time move the camera to that same place, at the same duration.
    To make the camera follow us, we'll use the pan command we learned about in |color:royalblue| lesson #12|reset , no-space|.
    If you have an active zoom in your script, you'll also need to change it too, or else it will stop focusing on your character.
    I currently don't have a zoom command set, so I don't need to change it.

        NARR
    Transitions are what we call the special effects we use in between scenes.
    Without transitions, our scenes will immediately pop in and out of nowhere.
    They also help us make sure that our scenes convey the right mood when we start or end them.
    In this lesson we'll learn about all types of transitions and what they can be used for.

    All transition types have the same template, which you can now see on your screen.
    Let's start by explaining which transition types there are.
    Episode has 4 transition types in total- |color:magenta| fade |reset , no-space|, |color:blue| iris |reset , no-space|, |color:forestgreen| shade |reset| & |color:purple| curtain |reset , no-space|.

    The first and most common transition is |color:magenta| fade |reset , no-space|.
@speechbubble is 160 359 to 100%
        NARR
    Fade has 2 directions- either "in" or "out". You'd usually want to use fade in at the beginning of a scene, and fade out at the end of it.
    Here's an example of a fade out:
@transition fade out 2

    The iris is great for showing that time passes, but can of course be used for many other reasons.
    Iris has 2 directions- either "in" or "out". You'd usually want to use iris in at the beginning of a scene, and iris out at the end of it.

    Transitions support these 9 colors.
    Specifying a color is optional- if you don't write the color, the transition will be black.
    Personally, I only use white fades in visions or dreams, and use other colorful transitions as fantasy effects.
@overlay ZZZ10166 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10166 clear
        NARR
    The time part of the template is also optional. If you don't specify the time, the transition will take 1 second.
    I personally recommend not making transitions longer than 3 seconds.
    2 seconds is a good time, as long transitions can make your readers lose patience.
@pause for .5
        NARR
    Notice that transition commands can only be used as a @ command, not a & command.
@overlay ZZZ10160 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10160 clear
        NARR
    Also, I'd like to address an issue many beginner authors struggle with, and I struggled with myself when I started.
    Sometimes, when you try to start a scene, your screen will flash before the transition starts.
    This happens if you place a command that has a duration before the transition starts.

&overlay ZZZ10168 create
&overlay ZZZ10168 to layer -14
        NARR
    Here's an example of a code that will make your screen flash.
    Why will your screen flash? Because of the command "@TAL is idle_sit_neutral_loop".
    This is an animation command, and animation commands have a duration.
    What will happen if I played this code?
    The zoom will reset, the camera will cut to zone 2, and my character will be spotted- those commands have no duration, they happen "in 0 seconds" so they won't cause a problem.
    But once my character does the sitting animation, the script will wait until the duration of that command is over, and only then will start the transition.
    While my character is sitting, the screen will be visible to your readers. This is what will cause the flash.
&overlay ZZZ10168 opacity 1 in 1
        NARR
    So how can I fix this? If I change my code to a & symbol instead of a @, the script will not wait for it. Remember |color:royalblue| lesson #3 |reset , no-space|?
&overlay ZZZ10167 clear
        NARR
    Now, |bold| this |reset| code will cause no problems.
    |bold| Here's a list of commands that could cause your transition to "flash":
    1) Animations, just like what we talked about.
    2) Anything with specified duration, like zooms or pans for example. Only if you specify their time and use a @ symbol.
    3) Overlays. We haven't learned about them yet, but they can also make your screen flash.
    For some reason, |bold| even when their time is set to 0 |reset, no-space|. So always write overlay commands with a & symbol.

    Remember how in |color:royalblue| Lesson #2 |reset| we learned the types of speechbubbles we have?
    In this lesson, we'll learn how to position the bubbles comfortably on your screen.
    Your script is designed to be smart and properly place speechbubbles on the screen. Kinda like an autopilot.
    Unfortunately, sometimes, it makes mistakes.
    This is why we have the tools to tell the script what to do, and we can "turn the autopilot" on and off.
    I see many authors, new and experienced alike, who say that doesn't really matter and choose to not fix speechbubble issues in their stories.
    But if you're like me, the next scene is going to upset you. I am sorry in advance!
@TAL2 becomes TAL
@TAL spot 1 -80 100 AND TAL2 spot 1 400 100

    Your speechbubbles have 3 factors- their place, their tail's direction, and their size.

    And you're there!
    If you tap the "Move" button, you'll be able to move the speechbubble around.
    If you tap the "Scale" button, you'll be able to change the size of the speechbubble. Notice that most of the times, there's no need for that.
    If you tap the "Cycle Tail" button, the tail of the speechbubble will change between its 4 positions.
    When you're happy with the result, click the "Copy" button under your previewer and paste the code into your script!

    Here are a few technical tips to help you:
    100% is the default bubble size.
    Narrator bubbles have no tails. So you can leave out that part in the code when positioning narrator speechbubbles.
    There are four tail directions: tail_top_left, tail_top_right, tail_bottom_left & tail_bottom_right.
    The "Show/Hide" button that is in the previewer's speechbubble menu will only hide it for you, not the readers.
    If you want your speechbubble be invisible, set its size to 0%.
    My personal tip is to make the tail of the speechbubble come out of the speaking character's hair, like this:
&overlay ZZZ10175 opacity 0 in 1 THEN overlay ZZZ10175 clear
@TAL spot 1 -100 100
@TAL walks to spot 1 100 100 in 2
@speechbubble is 168 257 to 100% with tail_top_left
        TAL (talk_explain_neutral)
    See where the tail is? Next to my neck, where my hair is.
        TAL (talk_agree_happy)
    This is a great place for speechbubbles to be in!

@TAL walks to spot 1 -100 100 in 2
@overlay ZZZ10179 create
&overlay ZZZ10179 opacity 1 in .5
        NARR
    And last but not least, speechbubbles that you define will not automatically get reset.
    You have to reset the speechbubble location after you're done with the placement you created, using this simple code!

    Scenes where usually there is a problem with speechbubble placements:

label lesson16part1

        NARR
    Up until now, when we coded on Episode, we put each command on a separate line of code, and let the code play out.
    But sometimes, we want to direct a |bold| chain of commands |reset , no-space|.
    A chain of commands is a way to tie commands together. It will tell a command to activate after or with commands that come before it.
    Up until now, we were able to do two things- tell the script to preform commands by line order, like a to-do list (using the @ symbol)
    Or tell the script to start commands and not wait for them to be over before starting the next one (using the & symbol).
    Using chains of commands, you can tell the script to start another command at the same time or after a certain command is activated.
    It may sound complicated right now, but it's easier and simpler than you think.

label lesson16part2
        NARR
    Chains of commands are written together on one line. That line can either start with an @ symbol or an & symbol.
    If you make it start with an @ symbol, the script will wait until your chain of commands ends and only then continue reading the script.
    If it starts with a & symbol, the chain of commands will activate and your script will continue while it is playing out.
    This is the most useful way of using chain commands, because if you want the script to wait until you're done, you may as well write your commands like you did until now and use a @ symbol on them.
    However, chains of commands are very useful and user-friendly, so I'm sure you will be using them more than you think.
    Chains of commands can be created using one of the following words: |color:royalblue| AND |reset| and |color:royalblue| THEN |reset , no-space|.
    If you place an AND in your chain, the commands that are tied together will happen at the same time.
    If you place a THEN in your chain, the second command will start once the first one is finished.

        NARR
    Take a look at this example. This is a short chain of commands that is built out of two commands and the AND feature.
    This way, you can write two commands in a single line and make them happen at the same time.

&TAL is standup_neutral THEN TAL is yawn_bored
        NARR
    And here's an example of a chain that uses the THEN feature.
    In this command, my character will first do the standing up animation, and then the yawn animation.
    It will also not wait for this sequence to end, because it uses the & symbol.
    So the script can continue working while the chain of commands works in the background. Pretty cool, huh?

        NARR
    I'm pretty sure most of us don't want our characters to keep wearing the same outfit for the entire story duration, right?
    There are two simple commands you can use in your script in order to change your characters' outfits.
    The first one is the "changes into" command. This command is the most common, and is also very simple.
&overlay ZZZ10184 opacity 1 in .5
@speechbubble is 160 302 to 100%
        NARR
    This is what the command looks like. Notice that it can only be used with the @ symbol, like speechbubbles.

        NARR
    Sometimes, you'd want your character to also make an animation that indicates that she's changing her outfit, if she does it during a scene.
    In that case, I recommend making your character use the "| color:green, no-space | dustoff_neutral_loop |reset , no-space|" animation and then change her outfit.
    After that, I usually put a pause for 0.5 seconds because in my eyes, it looks better.
    Don't forget to make your character change animations, because the dustoff animation is a looping animation and will not stop on its own!
    This is what it looks like:
&overlay ZZZ10185 create

    Now that you know the first command, time to introduce you to the second one- "previews".
    The previews command is really similar, but works a little different.
    I recommend using the "previews" command if you have any reason whatsoever to go back to your previous outfit.
    For example, if your character is trying outfits on at the store and needs to wear her regular outfit again, the one she went shopping in.
    Why? Because the previews command also comes with an "unpreviews" command that reverses it.
    Notice that it can only be used with the @ symbol, like the changes into command.

    We're finally going to learn how to create choices on Episode, which is super important!
    Up until now, every command we wrote was written on one line of code.
    Choices have a structure that looks different than the code we've seen so far.

        NARR
    The template for choices looks like this.
    If this looks complicated to you, don't worry! We'll explain everything in a moment!
    First of all, you need to know that a choice has to come with dialogue before it.
    The dialogue can be a great place to write the question you want to ask your readers.
    If there is no dialogue before the choice, you will get an error. So make sure to never put something like a zoom, speechbubble, or any other command between the choice and dialogue.
    The choice format must come |bold| immediately |reset| after a line of dialogue.
@pause for .5
        NARR
    Now that we have a line of dialogue, we need to move to a new line and write the word "choice", with no symbol in front of it.
    This is how you tell the script "Notice, I'm giving my readers a choice now".
    Then come your options. What are your options in this choice?
    Do you want to go on that date? What is your favorite color? Will you try and argue with your mom or stay silent?
readerMessage We'll learn how to make pages in choices in a future episode, if you want to have lots and lots of options!
        NARR
    Your options can be whatever you'd like, and you can create as many options as you want.
        NARR
    You must write your options in quotation marks, what will color them red in your script.
    Then, the outcome of your option must be surrounded by the symbols { and }.
    These symbols is what tells the script where the outcome for your option begins and ends. If you forget them, you'll get an error.
    In your outcome, you can write as many lines of code as you want. The reader will only see them in action if they chose the option that leads to this outcome.

        NARR

        NARR
    The first thing I'd like to teach you is what gains are.
    The gain command is used in order to give your readers something called "flags".
    A flag is like a checkpoint in the story. All flags your script encounters are saved in the player's game.
    They're usually used in choices, because then not all your readers will have the same flags.
    Flags are the easiest and most basic way for your readers' devices to remember choices!
    Personally, I almost never recommend using them, because they're irreversible- if you get a flag, you can't lose it.
    But they're still a simple and useful tool to know how to use.
    Are you still confused about what flags do? Let's see an example that will clear things up!

    Look at this choice, for example:

        NARR
    This choice lets us choose a favorite color out of 3 options.
    Inside every option for the choice, there is a different flag using the gain command.
    In the blue option, the flag is "blue". In the purple one, "purple". And in the yellow, "yellow".
    What does it mean? It means that when our readers read the story, they will pick their favorite color and will only get the flag of the option they've chosen.
    Some readers will have the "blue" flag, some "purple" and some "yellow".
    By giving those options flags using the gain command, we'll be able to tell the script to check if the reader has a certain flag, and if they do, make something happen.
    This is how authors branch their stories- they make choices matter using flags and similar methods.
&overlay ZZZ10191 opacity 0 in 1 THEN overlay ZZZ10191 clear
@pause for .5
        NARR
    So what flags are there?
    That's the fun part- you can name flags anything!
    ... Almost. There are a few rules:
    Flags can't contain spaces, and can't contain any weird symbols like # $ % &. You can use _ and - , though.
    So here's a mini - pop quiz: Which of these flag names is illegal and will cause an error?

    Now, let's talk about story loops!
    Story loops are a term to code that can repeat itself countless of times.
    For example, when you make a choice and the game asks you "are you sure?" and you say "no".
    You come back to making the choice again and if you wanted to, you could spend the rest of your life looping like this.
    Up until now, our code acted like a grocery list, going through the code in order.
    But now, I'm gonna teach you a way to tell your code to go somewhere, even if it's not the next thing it should be reading according to the line order of your script.
    First things first, we need to name that place where we want to go. We do that using a label.
    You can name a label just like you name a gain, with the same rules.
    Then, all that's left to do is use the goto command to go to that label.
    Let's see an example that'll help you understand better!
&overlay ZZZ10192 create
&overlay ZZZ10192 opacity 1 in .5

        NARR
    ...
@speechbubble is 160 388 to 100%
        NARR
    If you look at the third line in my example, you can see the label command!
    The label is kinda like a bookmark- you name that line and you can always tell the script to go to it.
    Just like in the lillies option path in this example!
    I didn't want you to choose lillies, so I brought you back to the line before the choice, so you can choose again!
@speechbubble reset
&overlay ZZZ10192 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10192 clear

    Let me show you this in a different way:

        NARR
    ...
@speechbubble reset
        NARR
    This chart is just to show you what the goto and label commands do.
    They allow you to move to different places in your script where you won't be getting automatically.
&overlay ZZZ10193 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10193 clear
        NARR
    This tool is also great for when your choices branch your story into different routes.
    We wouldn't want you to make the episode one giant choice, so you can put a goto in your choice and continue the script somewhere else.
    I hope the gotos and labels are clear to you now!

    |bold| This lesson comes with an assignment - I want you to build a "choosing outfit" game from scratch.
    In the last 3 lessons you've learned everything you need in order to create such a game.
    You can now change outfits, create choices, and now you know how to go back to the choice.
    So here are a few instructions:
    Make a dressing game with 3 outfit options.
    When a reader chooses an outfit, they should get another choice of "Are you sure this is the outfit you want to wear?" with "yes" and "no" as options.
    If the player clicks "yes", the game ends. Make your character say something like "I'm ready for school now!" or anything you find suitable to say.
    If the player clicks "no", make your character say something like "I should check the other outfits again" and use the goto command to bring them back to the beginning of the dressing game.
    You don't have to use gains in this exercise because I still didn't teach you how to check for gains, only how to create them.
    I know there are quite a few outfit game templates online- the point of the exercise is for you to create one from zero, without copying other templates.
    It'll help you get a grip of everything we learned in the past few lessons and will basically be the first minigame you made from zero, all by yourselves!
    If you struggle or get confused or stuck, my forum thread is a great place to ask for my help in!
    It's called "Tal's Coding 101 - Questions & Help With Directing"!
    If you upload your finished game to Instagram, make sure to tag me and use the hashtag #talscoding101 so that I can see what you made!

    Music and sounds are a great way to add another dimension to your story.

@speechbubble is 160 337 to 100%
        NARR
    To add music or sound to your story, use either the "music" command, or the "sound" command.
    Notice that those commands don't have any symbol coming in front of them- there is no @music or &sound!
    All of your sounds are located in one place- in your portal, to your right, under the previewer.
    To see all of the music and sound options available, tap the "Sounds" button in the "Library" section!
@pause for .5
        NARR
    If you define a new sound to play while an old sound is still playing, the old sound will stop playing and the new one will begin instead.
    Same goes for music.
    However, music and sounds can play at the same time without interrupting each other.
@overlay ZZZ10194 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10194 clear

        NARR
    Can you play music using the sound command, or play sounds using the music command?
    Yes! The portal sees all music and sounds as the same types of audio.
    Then what do we need two commands for?
    The music and sound commands have one main difference-
    The music command will play your audio in an infinite loop until you tell it to stop. The sound command will only play it once.
volume music 0 2000
        NARR
    So please, while using music audios with the sound command is still okay...
readerMessage Annoying sound warning ♥

    Another great tool for using music and sounds is the "volume" command.
    You can use it for transitions into music, instead of just making it play suddenly.
    You can also simply use it if you want to change the volume of your audio.
&overlay ZZZ10196 create

@speechbubble is 160 314 to 100%
        NARR
    This command, like the music and sound commands, doesn't have a symbol in front of it.
    Notice that the time in this command isn't written in seconds, but in milliseconds for some reason.
    That means that instead of writing 5 seconds, for example, you'll have to write 5000.
    Notice that when you turn your volume down, it will stay that way until you change it.
    So if you turn your volume to 0, make sure to just stop the music and bring the volume back to 100.
    Or else, you might be searching for the "bug" that won't let you play music for hours.
@overlay ZZZ10196 opacity 0 in .5 THEN overlay ZZZ10196 clear

        NARR
    Notice that all of those commands (music, sound, volume) don't have a symbol, but act as if they have the & symbol in front of them.
    They will activate and the script will move on, not waiting for them.
    Therefore, if you change the volume or use a sound, make sure that enough time passes for the command to end.

        NARR
    For example, let's say that your volume changes to 0 in the middle of a dialogue.
    You want to make sure enough time passes before the next music command activates.
    In that case, you'll have to guess how long it will take your readers to read through the dialogue.
    If your dialogue is too short, the volume command will not have enough time to finish its task.
    In that case, just wait for a couple more lines before you use a new audio-related command.

label lesson21part1
@pause for 0
        NARR
    What are overlays?
    Overlays are images we can add to our scene, kinda like we can add characters.
    They're very useful for making your story look even more impressive.
    They're a tool most big authors use, and can make a story look more cinematic.
    You can use the overlays that the portal provides in the Art Catalog, or upload your own, like with backgrounds.
@pause for .5
        NARR
    How to add overlays to your scene?
    There are two ways to do that- either at the beginning of a scene, or during an ongoing scene.
&overlay ZZZ10199 create
@overlay ZZZ10199 opacity 1 in .5
@speechbubble is 160 376 to 100%
        NARR
    If you want your overlay to be in a scene as soon as the scene begins, you can create and spot it by adding the information about it at the same line where the background is declared.
    You need to specify the overlay |color:skyblue| name|reset, no-space|, and can also specify its |color:green| size |reset, no-space|, |color:purple| location |reset, no-space|, |color:orange| zone |reset, no-space|, and |color:pink| layer.
    The overlay size here is only one number, like in the advanced spot command.
    And the location is specified using the x and y axis, like in the advanced spot command, too.
    Notice that the opacity of all overlays you create at the beginning of the scene is 1 as default.

@speechbubble is 160 357 to 100%
        NARR
    The |bold| create |reset| command creates your overlay in case it doesn't exist in the scene yet.
    It will position your overlay in the spot 0 0, set your overlay size to 1 1, place it in a random layer and set its opacity to 0 (AKA invisible).
    Oh yeah, by the way, meet our assistant for today's lesson- Mimi the cow! 😄

    The |bold| shifts to |reset| command lets you place your overlay where you want it to be at the scene.
    It works similarly to the advanced spot command for characters.
&overlay 5451627470782464_COW shifts to 16 217 in zone 1 in 2
        NARR
    You don't have to specify time, but if you do, your overlay will move from its previous location to the new occasion in the time you've given it.

    The |bold| scales to |reset| command lets you resize your overlay.
    Unlike the command used at the beginning of the scene, this command has 2 numbers used, not 1.

        NARR
    The overlay opacity can be a number between 0 and 1 and it determines how transparent your overlay is.
    0 means invisible, and 1 means fully visible.
    If you don't use this command when you create an overlay mid-scene using the create command, you won't be able to see it, as the default opacity is 0.

    Meet the |bold| rotates |reset| command! This command is the naughty sibling of the previous commands, because unless you understand how it works, it'll look like it's misbehaving and not doing what you asked it to.
    I've seen and helped several well-known authors with this exact command, but do not fear- the reason people have issues with this command is because they don't understand how it works.
    They "wing it" and improvise while using it, and so in certain scenarios it might look like it has a will of its own and won't behave like you want it to.
    But that's what we're here for! If you pay attention to this lesson, I promise that you'll know how to deal with it!
    So let's start!

        NARR
    Your overlay can rotate in various different ways.
    The |bold| anchor point |reset| is the exact spot in your overlay around which the entire overlay will rotate.
    No matter what size your overlay is, the anchor points will always be the same:
    The bottom left corner will be 0 0, the top right corner will be 1 1,
    The top left corner will be 0 1, the bottom right corner will be 1 0,
    And the center of your overlay will be 0.5 0.5.
    Let me demonstrate what happens when you give your overlays different anchor points to rotate around.
    This is a rotation around the anchor point 0 0.
@overlay COW rotates 360 anchor point 0 0 in 2
        NARR
    This is when the anchor point is .5 .5
&overlay 5451627470782464_COW shifts to 161 184 in zone 1
&overlay COW rotates 0 anchor point 0.5 0.5

&overlay COW rotates 0 anchor point 1 1
@overlay COW rotates 360 anchor point 1 1 in 2

        NARR
    Unfortunately, there is something I haven't told you about rotating overlays.
    For a bizarre reason, Episode made it so that when you rotate overlays, they change their position from where you set them to be.
    That's because the portal only knows how to rotate your overlay around the 0 0 anchor point.
    So instead of rotating the overlay around the anchor point you choose, Episode moves the overlay so that the anchor point you chose is at 0 0.
    Let me show you what I mean. I'm about to rotate Mimi around the .5 .5 anchor point. Watch what happens.
&overlay 5451627470782464_COW shifts to 24 73 in zone 1
&overlay COW rotates 0 anchor point 0 0
@overlay COW rotates 360 anchor point 0.5 0.5 in 2
        NARR
    Did you notice? The anchor point .5 .5, which is the middle of my overlay, got moved to the place where anchor point 0 0 should be.
    Mimi is rotating around her center, the anchor point is indeed 0.5 0.5, but it moved, and so Mimi moved.
    Oof, that's frustrating! What do we do, then?!
    Well, we simply have to change the location of the overlay. We have to manually drag it back to its place.
@overlay 5451627470782464_COW shifts to 161 184 in zone 1 in 1
        NARR
    So how do we know where to place the overlay?
    The most common and used option is to do the following:
    1) rotate your overlay around the anchor point of your choosing in 0 degrees. It'll change the overlay's place.
    2) Open the previewer and use the spotting tool, just like with characters, to drag it where you want it to be.
    3) Replace the rotate command with the one you were going to use.
    However, I did a bit of digging, and discovered that there is a way to calculate where your overlay should be standing.
    It took me a while, but I wrote the formula for placing your overlay correctly when it turns.
    If you never want to use it, that's 100% okay. But if you're a perfectionist or need your overlay placement to be accurate, I am sharing the formula with you:

        NARR
    If you want to make overlay animations repeat themselves, you can use the "loop" feature at the end of a chain of commands that creates 1 loop of your overlay animation.
    For example, if you want your overlay to blink in and out of a scene, make a chain of commands that makes the overlay opacity 1 (specify time!) and then one of opacity 0.
    Then, you'll add the loop feature at the end of your chain.
    In the loop feature, you can either choose a number to specify how many times you want your animation to repeat itself, or write "inf", which will make it loop infinite times.
    You can also write the word infinite instead of just inf, but inf is shorter to type and so I like using it more.
    Notice a few important things about looping overlay animations:
    1) When looping through infinite times, |bold| NEVER |reset| use the @ symbol. Only the & one.
    If you use @, your script will wait for the command to end, but since it loops infinite times, your readers will be stuck forever.
    2) You can only use overlay commands in your chain of commands. Other commands inside the chain will give you an error.
    That's because the loop command can only work with overlay commands.
    A pro tip from me: if you want to use a pause command, like "pause for 1" for example, inside your loop,
    Instead of using a pause command (because you can't), try to create an invisible change to an overlay that lasts that time.
    For example, if your overlay is already at spot 50 100, make it move there in 1. It won't move, because it's already there, but it will last 1 second.
    You'll get the same effect as the pause, but without creating an error with the loop feature!
    And 3) Only use the THEN connector, not the AND connector. The loop feature doesn't know how to work with this connector and will give you an error.
    If you need several things to happen at the same time, you'll have to create two different commands that will run at the same time.

    Another great overlay feature I'd like to introduce to you is the ui.
    Overlays, like characters, stick to an area in your background.
    However, there is a way to make your overlays stick to |bold| the camera |reset| instead, like speechbubbles do.

    Simply write the word "ui" instead of "overlay" in your overlay commands!
    Notice that you can't create uis with your background like you can with overlays, you have to use the create command for those.
    Also notice that you can't mix ui and overlay commands with the same overlay. You either create your overlay as a ui or as an overlay.
    Uis are great for things like framing your scenes. I love using this feature with a "flashback" frame of clouds or when I use the RECORDING overlay from the art catalog.
    That way, when you zoom in and out of scenes, the overlay moves along with your camera.

    So far, we've learned the most simple way of creating choices.
    However, choices can also be assigned certain features that can either help you as an author or change the way the choices behave.
    Let's begin with the simplest one, and one that is very important to you as an author: naming choices.
    As authors, knowing which options our readers picked in our choices can be very useful.
    That way, we can refer to past choices in our script and see how the options the reader chose should affect the story.

        NARR
    When you create a choice regularly, you don't give it a name, so you can't refer to it in the future.
    But if you name your choices, you'll be able to check which options the reader picked!

    To name a choice, you need to write your desired choice name in brackets next to the word "choice".
    In a future lesson we will learn how to remember choices and check what options the user chose, and we'll use the feature of naming choices to accomplish that!
    Personally, I recommend to |bold| always |reset| name |bold| every |reset| choice you have in the story.
    You never know when it could be useful to you in future scenes or episodes!

        NARR
    Some important things to remember about naming choices:
    1) I don't recommend naming several choices the same- you won't get an error or a warning, but you'll always get the result of the last choice with that name.
    For example, if I name two different choices "my_choice", when I try to see the result of the choice "my_choice",
    I'll get the result of the last "my_choice" the player encountered.
    I'll lose all of my data for the older "my_choice", So always give your choices unique names!
    A tip from me (and what I do): I usually name outfit choices as "outfit" and then the episode number.
    For example, "outfit_ep1" for the outfit choice in episode 1 and "outfit_ep23" for the one in episode 23.
    That way I can be certain that I won't accidentally name two choices the same name.
    If you have more than one outift choice, for example, you can name them "outfit_ep1_1" and "outfit_ep1_2".
    I do the same with other choices, for example, interactions with a love interest can be called "<your love interest's name>_ch3".
    Those are of course just tips from me!

        NARR
    2) If your story has a loop and the reader might encounter the same choice several times, only the last decision will be remembered.
    For example, here, you'll get to the same choice again if you choose "yup", because the goto feature would send you back to the choice.
    In that case, when you leave the choice using the "What? No!" option, this would be the option remembered by the script.

    Now onto gem choices! Episode lets us authors include gem choices in our stories.
    Since gem choices cost gems, there are certain rules for using them:
    1) You can't put more than 5 gem choices in a single branch. A branch is what we call the "path" your readers take while playing.
    In other words, when your readers read an episode, they can't encounter more than 5 different gem choices.
    If you try to do this, you'll get an error.
    2) Gem choices must have at least one free option- you can't create a choice that forces people to spend gems to play.
    3) You can decide the cost of your gem options, but only from the following list: 5💎, 8💎, 12💎, 15💎, 17💎, 22💎, 28💎 and 35💎.
    I personally use the 5💎 cost for things in my stories, and sometimes 8💎 for the bigger, more important, purchases.
    I find the other amounts to be quite expensive, but that's of course up to you!

    With that logic, if you write the name of a gain that doesn't exist...
    No one will ever see that option, but the code will still think that this is the last option and will send the reader to it if the time's up.
    Brilliant, isn't it? I like to use the gain "times_up" because it makes sense to look at.

    Aside from choices, that have those buttons you have to press to select things, there is also a feature called "tappables".
    Tappables, or tappable overlays, are choices that use overlays as buttons.
    They are used less frequently than choices, but can be used for a lot of diverse ideas for your stories.
    From menus (like the lessons menu for this course!) to minigames, possibilities are practically limitless.
    So how to use them? That's actually pretty simple!

    An important thing to point out- when making tappables, make sure that the overlays you use can be tapped on, or else the readers will get stuck.
    For example, don't use overlays that weren't created, and make sure that the overlay is within your camera's range.
    Also, unfortunately, you can't name tappables like you can do with choices.
    If we want to remember choices done with tappables, we'll have to use other ways, like using gains.
    We'll learn how to remember choices in a future lesson!

    Tappables have one more awesome feature that choices don't have- allowing readers to move the camera.
    While a tappable is waiting for the author's selection, you can make it so that they can swipe the screen and move the camera, even to different zones!

    This is how it's done: next to the tappable, you have to write "pan:", then the beginning zone you want to allow the readers to move in, a colon, and then the ending zone.
    You write it in square brackets, just like is shown below!
    In the example below, I let the readers move the screen between the zones 1-4.

    There's one last thing I want to tell you.
    The tappable feature has been introduced to Episode around 4 or 5 years ago (as of March 2023).
    Yet, for some reason, it's considered a "beta" feature.
    Because of that, if you ever encounter issues with tappables, the Episode support team might not assist you.
    It happened to me and it sucks, but it didn't stop me from using tappables.
    Issues are pretty rare and if they happen, just find a creative workaround or change the tappable into a regular choice!

    As of now, when we moved around zooms and overlays, we moved them in a straight line and at a constant pace.
    However, Episode has a feature called "easing" that changes the way overlays and zooms behave when they move.
    In this lesson, we'll explore the different ways overlays can ease from place to place.
    Don't worry, this lesson will have a summary sheet, so don't feel overwhelmed!

        NARR
    A few things worth mentioning:
    1) The "linear" function is the default one and there really isn't any reason to add "using linear" to commands.
    2) The longer the distance that your overlay or zoom has to travel, the stronger the easing effect will be.
    For example, if the ball was located further away from its destination, it would've bounced higher when it reached it.
    And 3) Don't be fooled by the ball example- there is no gravity on Episode!
    This means that I just used the ball falling down as an example.
    It would've worked just the same even if I'd wanted it to "fall" up, left, right, or in diagonal.

    In the next lessons, we'll learn how to add some more useful features to our choices!
        NARR
    We'll also be learning about conditions, which are essential for remembering choices.
    And we'll also learn how to make our zooms and overlays move with special effects, and not just in a straight line.
    Super cool stuff you should definitely know how to use!

    By choosing the "Support Tal" option, you increase my chances of unlocking the writer's payments program!
    If enough people read my stories and choose to support me, Episode will start giving me a monthly salary and writing on Episode will become my job!
    I know many people don't have the money or gems to support me, and I completely understand! This is why this course is free of charge and only costs passes that get refilled for free anyways!
    However, if you do have some gems and find this course helpful, please consider helping me out! I'll be forever grateful! <3
